# Blockchain-X-SCM
Supply chain management solution powered by blockchain

## Set up

### Step 0: Download the repo and dependencies

`Git clone` this repo; that's where your journey will begin!
```
git clone https://github.com/WoW-YaY/Blockchain-X-SCM.git && cd Blockchain-X-SCM
```

Install dependencies. Don't worry, all the dependencies you need are already laid out in the `package.json` file, all you need to do is run the following code in your terminal:
```
npm i
```

Of course, you also need to go into the `./client` folder and execute the same command:
```
cd client && npm I
cd ..
```

Install *ganache-cli*. *Ganache* is an Ethereum node emulator software that lets you compile the blockchain locally, and *ganache-cli* is the command-line version of it.
```
npm i -g ganache-cli
```

### Step 1: Compile the contracts

To run a blockchain-based supply chain solution smoothly, you first need to compile the code (smart contracts) in this repo on a certain blockchain network. Smart contracts are typically written in the Solidity language and are used to specify the rules for transactions in the blockchain.

You can use a local test blockchain built by Ganache, which will automatically create a batch of local wallet accounts and allocate a certain number of virtual tokens, or you can compile directly on a public test chain, which will require you to have accounts with the relevant on-chain tokens. If your goal is to understand the principles, we recommend that you compile on your local test chain, unless you need to commercialize the solution at scale.

Option 1: Compile the contracts locally (Recommended)
```
ganache-cli --accounts 10 --gasLimit 6721975000
```

Open a new terminal, run:
```
truffle migrate --network=develop --reset
```

Option 2: Compile the contracts on the public (test) chain
```
truffle migrate --network=mumbai --reset
```

### Step 2: Open the client

Before you start the following steps, ensure you have registered for a Metamask account and installed the Metamask plugin on your Chrome browser. The following demonstration is based on using a locally compiled test blockchain, if you want to use a public test chain, you may need to make changes to some configuration parameters, please refer to the code or contact the author for details.

Open a new terminal, run:

```
cd client
npm start
```

You'll then be taken to a pop-up window in your browser (if you don't have one, you can type `http://localhost:3000/` into your browser's address bar). You need to log in to your Metamask account:

Only after that will you be able to access our gorgeous interface.

Now you're in our client! But it doesn't know which account to use to connect to which blockchain. These will be configured in the next two steps.

### Step 3: Configuring the Test Network

First, go to the network switch page:

Click "Add network":

Click "Add a network manually":

Configure according to the following parameters:

Switching clients to the "develop" network:

### Step 4: Import the wallet address (generated by the ganache compilation)

When compiling a blockchain network with ganache, it automatically generates a batch (the exact number can be specified by --accounts) of wallet addresses. Copy the private key from it:

Click on the wallets list:

Click "Add account or hardware wallet":

Click "Import account":

Paste the private key you just copied into the input box:

Finally, make sure the wallet address you just added is connected and active:

At this point, you should be able to register roles on the "LOGIN" page for the accounts you've added! The account will then be able to perform activities based on the registered roles.
